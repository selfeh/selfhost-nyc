3. **Any contracts involving Google products or services procured through intermediaries, resellers, or state contracts** (e.g., CDWG, SHI International, Carahsoft, or NYS OGS contracts) where Google is the ultimate provider.

4. **Any audits, reviews, or investigative reports** conducted by the Comptroller's office related to technology procurement, cloud services, or data management contracts.
