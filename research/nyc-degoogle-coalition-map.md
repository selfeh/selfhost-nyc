*Research compiled 2026-02-17*

---

## 1. PRECEDENTS: Cities/States/Countries That De-Googled or Moved to Open Source

### 🇩🇪 Munich, Germany (LiMux) — The Landmark Case
- **2004-2013**: Migrated 15,000+ desktops from Windows to Linux (LiMux) and LibreOffice
- **Saved €11.7 million** ($16M) and gained software decision independence
- **2017**: Political reversal back to Windows — widely attributed to Microsoft lobbying (moved HQ to Munich) and mayoral politics, NOT technical failure. Investigative journalism (ARD/Investigate Europe) found most city workers were satisfied
- **2020**: New Green/SPD coalition reversed the reversal — committed to open source "where technically and financially possible"
- **Oct 2024**: City doubled down with a **5-point open-source plan** and founded an **Open Source Program Office (OSPO)** with €200K budget
- **Lesson**: Political will matters more than technical feasibility. Industry lobbying is the real threat.

### 🇩🇪 Schleswig-Holstein, Germany
