Dear FOIL Officer,

Pursuant to the New York State Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law §§84-90), I request access to the following records:

## Records Requested

1. **All current contracts, agreements, master service agreements, and purchase orders** between OTI (or its predecessor DoITT) and Google LLC, Google Cloud, Alphabet Inc., or any subsidiary thereof, including:
   - Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services
   - Google Workspace licenses for city employees
   - Any data analytics, AI/ML, or infrastructure services
   - Google Translate or language access services (ref: Mayor's December 2025 directive)

2. **Total spending on Google products and services** for fiscal years 2020–2025, broken down by agency, product category, and contract vehicle (direct purchase, requirements contract, state piggyback, etc.).

3. **All contracts or agreements related to NYC Cyber Command's use of Google Cloud Platform**, including GCP services (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Kubernetes/GKE, BeyondCorp), infrastructure costs, and any managed services agreements.

4. **All sole-source justifications** for Google-related procurements, and any market research or alternatives analysis conducted pursuant to PPB Rules §2-02.

5. **Records of any citywide technology standards or policies** mandating or recommending Google products over alternatives, including any OTI directives to agencies regarding cloud platform selection.

6. **Any data sovereignty, data residency, or data processing agreements** specifying where NYC government data is stored, who has access, and what happens to city data upon contract termination.

7. **Exit strategy or data portability documentation** for any Google contract — i.e., the city's plan for migrating off Google services if contracts are terminated or not renewed.

8. **The February 2025 NYS statewide Google Cloud agreement** that NYC agencies may leverage, including the terms, pricing, and any NYC-specific amendments.

9. **Any internal assessments comparing Google Cloud to alternatives** (AWS, Azure, self-hosted/on-premises, open-source) for city workloads.

## Format

Electronic format preferred (PDF, spreadsheet, native format).

## Fee Waiver

Requested on public interest grounds — this information concerns the management of public data and taxpayer-funded technology infrastructure.
