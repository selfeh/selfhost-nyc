# selfhost.nyc

**Campaign to transition New York City off Google to self-hosted, publicly-owned infrastructure.**

NYC spends an estimated $30–70 million per year on Google — hidden from public databases. Google powers ICE's cloud, refuses to sign student privacy laws, and fired workers at its NYC office for protesting a $1.2B military AI contract. Meanwhile, NYC calls itself a sanctuary city.

It's time to self-host.
