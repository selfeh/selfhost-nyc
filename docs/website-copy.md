# New York Pays for Google's Crimes.

## The Numbers

- **$30–70M/yr** NYC pays Google. The exact figure isn't in any public database.
- **1.1 million** NYC students on Google Workspace. Google won't sign the state child privacy law.
- **$1.2 billion** Google's contract to provide AI to Israel's military.
- **$9 billion** Google's Pentagon cloud deal. CBP is a customer.
- **$118 million** Google's gender discrimination settlement. 15,500 women.
- **$307 billion** Google's 2023 revenue. Same year they laid off 12,000 workers.
- **$1.32/hr** What Google pays AI trainers in Kenya.
- **30 days** To exit. The termination clauses are already in the contracts.

# /WHY — THE EVIDENCE

# What New York Is Paying For

---

## Children

1.1 million NYC public school students use Google Workspace. 350,000 Chromebooks in classrooms across all five boroughs.

New York State Ed-Law 2-d requires companies to sign data privacy agreements before handling student data. Google refuses to sign for its "Additional Services" — YouTube, Maps, Search — the products students use daily through their school accounts.

The DOE signed the contracts anyway. There's no evidence of competitive bidding. Estimated annual cost: $5–20 million.

---

## Money

NYC spends an estimated $30–70 million a year on Google products and services. That number does not appear in Checkbook NYC or the city's Open Data portal.

NYC Cyber Command — responsible for cybersecurity across 100+ city agencies — runs entirely on Google Cloud. Estimated cost: $10–30 million a year. No public contract record found.

No competitive bidding documentation. No published cost-benefit analysis. No exit plan.

---

## Immigration

NYC is a sanctuary city. City law prohibits agencies from cooperating with ICE. The Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs serves 600,000+ undocumented residents.

NYC also pays Google. Here's what Google does with the money:

- Holds a cloud infrastructure contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (2019)
- Sits on the $9 billion JWCC military cloud contract serving DOD, DHS, and intelligence agencies
- Created Google Public Sector LLC — a subsidiary dedicated to military and law enforcement contracts
- Signed a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) to provide AI to Israel's military, including facial detection, object tracking, and sentiment analysis

In April 2024, approximately 50 Google workers were fired for staging a sit-in at the company's NYC office to protest Project Nimbus.

---

## Labor

Google's 2023 revenue: $307 billion. In January 2023, Google laid off 12,000 workers. Accounts were locked before employees were told.

Other facts:

- Roughly half of Google's workforce are temps, vendors, and contractors — same work, lower pay, fewer benefits
- AI trainers in Kenya earn $1.32–$2.00/hr through subcontractors, handling violent and traumatic content
- Google ran "Project Vivian," an internal anti-union campaign using hired consultants
- The NLRB found Google illegally fired employee organizers (the "Thanksgiving Four," 2019)
- Google paid $118 million to settle gender discrimination claims from 15,500 women
- Data center workers have reported being denied water breaks

---

## Lock-in

Google has invested $2.1 billion in NYC real estate — Chelsea, Hudson Square, 12,000+ employees — with city tax incentives.

In return:

- NYC agencies depend on Google Cloud with no documented migration plan
- Every school on Workspace depends on a platform the city doesn't own or control
- The city cannot audit, modify, or move its data without Google's cooperation
- Contract values are hidden from the city's own transparency tools

# /HOW

# How This Ends

## The exit clauses already exist.

NYC's standard contract language includes termination-for-convenience provisions. The city can end any of these contracts with 30 days' written notice. No breach required.

## Who can act:

- **Comptroller Mark Levine** can refuse to register Google contracts — effectively blocking renewals
- **City Council Technology Committee** (Chair: Carmen De La Rosa) can hold hearings, subpoena records, and draft legislation
- **Any City Council member** can introduce legislation requiring contract transparency, open-source alternatives, or data sovereignty standards

## Precedent:

- **CityTime (2011):** NYC terminated a corrupt $700M+ tech contract and recovered $500 million
- **Amazon HQ2 (2019):** Public pressure killed a $3 billion corporate subsidy deal
- **Munich:** Migrated 15,000 government desktops to Linux. Saved €11.7 million.
- **France:** 72,000 police computers running Ubuntu. Custom-built secure messaging on Matrix.
- **Schleswig-Holstein:** 30,000 PCs switching to Nextcloud and LibreOffice.

## What we're demanding:

1. **Publish every active Google contract** — costs, terms, data provisions, renewal dates. Put them in Checkbook NYC.
2. **Terminate and transition** — Use the existing exit clauses. Begin a managed migration to publicly-owned infrastructure over 3 years.
3. **Protect students first** — Move NYC schools off Google Workspace. No platform that won't comply with Ed-Law 2-d.
4. **Ban conflicted vendors** — No city contracts with companies holding military or immigration enforcement contracts.
5. **Create a NYC Digital Infrastructure Office** — Public staff, public code, public accountability.

> Hi, I'm [NAME] from [NEIGHBORHOOD]. I'm calling to ask [COUNCIL MEMBER] to support a full review of NYC's contracts with Google. The city spends tens of millions with no public transparency, and Google's federal contracts with CBP and the military conflict with our sanctuary city values. I'd like [COUNCIL MEMBER] to support Council hearings and co-sponsor legislation requiring disclosure of all tech vendor contracts. Thank you.

# /ABOUT

# About

selfhost.nyc is a campaign to end New York City's financial relationship with Google and move the city's technology to publicly-owned infrastructure.

## Why now

- The spending is hidden. Tens of millions per year, invisible in public databases.
- The conflicts are documented. Google serves CBP, DHS, and foreign militaries while NYC claims sanctuary status.
- The alternatives are proven. Governments across Europe have already migrated.

## Coalition

Organizations supporting this effort:

**Digital Rights:** S.T.O.P. · EFF · Parent Coalition for Student Privacy
**Community Tech:** NYC Mesh · May First Movement Technology
**Labor:** UFT · DC37
**Research:** AI Now Institute · The Markup

## FAQ

**Can NYC actually do this?**
NYC terminated the CityTime contract and recovered $500 million. New Yorkers killed Amazon's $3 billion HQ2 deal. Munich switched 15,000 desktops to Linux. Yes.

**What replaces Google?**
Open-source software already used by governments worldwide: Nextcloud, LibreOffice, Matrix/Element, OpenStack, Kubernetes on city-owned servers. The technology exists. It's cheaper. And the city would own it.

**Will it cost more?**
Munich saved €11.7 million. But NYC can't answer this question either — the city doesn't publicly report what it currently pays Google. Transparency comes first.

**What about Google's 12,000 NYC employees?**
They work on Search, Ads, and commercial products — not city contracts. A public infrastructure program would create unionized city tech jobs.
