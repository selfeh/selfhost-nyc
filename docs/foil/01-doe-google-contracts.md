Dear FOIL Officer,

Pursuant to the New York State Freedom of Information Law (Public Officers Law §§84-90), I request access to the following records:

## Records Requested

1. **All current contracts, agreements, memoranda of understanding, and purchase orders** between the NYC Department of Education and Google LLC, Google Cloud, Alphabet Inc., or any subsidiary thereof, including but not limited to:
   - Google Workspace for Education licenses (all tiers: free, Education Standard, Education Plus, Teaching & Learning Upgrade)
   - Chromebook procurement contracts (including Dell or other hardware vendors where ChromeOS/Google licensing is a component)
   - Google Cloud Platform services
   - Any other Google products or services

2. **The total dollar amount spent** by the DOE on Google products, services, and licenses for fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 (to date), broken down by product/service category.

3. **All sole-source justifications or competitive bidding documentation** related to the selection of Google Workspace for Education over alternative platforms (including but not limited to Microsoft 365 Education, open-source alternatives such as Nextcloud/LibreOffice, or other vendors).

4. **All data privacy agreements, data processing agreements, and Ed-Law 2-d supplemental agreements** between the DOE and Google, including:
   - Any agreements (signed or unsigned) related to Google "Additional Services" (YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search, etc.)
   - Records of any requests by the DOE for Google to sign Ed-Law 2-d agreements that were declined or remain pending
   - Any risk assessments or privacy impact assessments conducted regarding student data in Google services

5. **The current number of Google Workspace accounts** (student and staff), Chromebooks deployed, and any planned expansions or renewals.

6. **Any correspondence between DOE officials and Google representatives** regarding contract terms, pricing, data privacy, or service issues from January 2023 to present.

7. **Any internal DOE assessments, reports, or memoranda** evaluating alternatives to Google Workspace or assessing risks of Google dependency.

## Format

I request records in electronic format (PDF, spreadsheet, or native format) where available.

## Fee Waiver

I request a fee waiver as this information is sought for public interest purposes — to inform the public about how NYC manages student data and technology spending. The disclosure will contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations.

## Response

I expect acknowledgment within five (5) business days as required by FOIL. If any records are withheld, please cite the specific exemption and provide a redacted version where possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

Sincerely,
