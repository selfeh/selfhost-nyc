## Headline

# New York City Pays Google Millions.<br>Google Powers the Deportation Machine.<br>It's Time to Self-Host.

## The Problem in 30 Seconds

New York City hands Google an estimated **$30–70 million every year** — and hides the receipts. Google runs our kids' classrooms, our cybersecurity, our city agencies. In return, Google mines our children's data, busts unions, powers ICE's cloud infrastructure, and arms the Israeli military with AI surveillance.

NYC calls itself a sanctuary city. Then it writes checks to the company building the tools to hunt immigrants.

**We can stop this. The contracts have exit clauses. The alternatives exist. Other cities have already done it.**

All that's missing is political will. That's where you come in.

## Key Stats

> **1.1 MILLION** NYC public school students on Google Workspace

> **$30–70M/YR** in estimated city spending on Google — exposed in zero public databases

> **$9 BILLION** Google's military cloud contract (JWCC) powering CBP and DOD

> **30 DAYS** That's all it takes to terminate. The exit clauses already exist.

> **€11.7 MILLION** Saved by Munich after switching 15,000 desktops to Linux

> **~50 WORKERS** Fired at Google's NYC office for protesting Project Nimbus (April 2024)

---

## Call to Action

### This isn't a petition. It's a campaign.

We're building a coalition of parents, teachers, union members, immigrants, technologists, and elected officials to force New York City to terminate all contracts with Google and transition to publicly-owned, self-hosted infrastructure.

# /WHY — WHY NYC MUST DROP GOOGLE

# Why New York City Must Drop Google

This isn't about hating technology. It's about who controls it, who profits from it, and who gets hurt. Here's the case — in five parts.

---

## 1. Our Children Are the Product

# 1.1 Million Kids. Zero Accountability.

New York City put **1.1 million public school students** on Google Workspace and handed out **350,000 Chromebooks**. The Department of Education spends an estimated **$5–20 million a year** on this arrangement.

Here's what parents don't know: **Google refuses to sign New York State Education Law 2-d privacy agreements for its "Additional Services."** That's the law designed to protect children's data. Google won't agree to it — and the city signed the contracts anyway.

Ed-Law 2-d exists because children can't consent to data collection. They can't opt out of their school's platform. When a seven-year-old logs into a Chromebook in the Bronx, they enter Google's ecosystem with no exit. Their search patterns, their writing, their behavioral data — captured by a company whose entire business model is turning attention into advertising revenue.

> **Google won't sign the state privacy law for children's data. The city doesn't care. Your kid is on the platform anyway.**

The DOE claims Google Workspace for Education is safe. But "Workspace" and "Additional Services" aren't the same thing. YouTube, Google Maps, Google Search — these are "Additional Services" with weaker protections, and students use them every day through the same accounts.

Other cities have alternatives. NYC has excuses.

---

## 2. The Money Is Hidden

# $30–70 Million a Year. No Receipts.

Try to find NYC's Google contracts in Checkbook NYC. They're not there. Try the Open Data portal. Nothing. Try FOIL requests. Good luck.

New York City spends an estimated **$30–70 million per year** on Google products and services across agencies. **NYC Cyber Command — the agency responsible for the city's entire cybersecurity posture — runs on Google Cloud**, at an estimated cost of **$10–30 million annually**.

> **The city's cybersecurity infrastructure is controlled by a single private corporation. You can't find the contract in any public database.**

There's no evidence of competitive bidding for these arrangements. No public cost-benefit analysis. No transition planning. The city locked itself into dependency on a $2 trillion corporation and didn't bother telling taxpayers.

This isn't oversight. It's policy. When spending is invisible, accountability is impossible.

Every dollar NYC sends to Google is a dollar not spent on public infrastructure that the city actually owns and controls. Infrastructure that can't be enshittified, re-priced, or data-mined when corporate priorities shift.

---

## 3. Sanctuary City, Google Money

# NYC Protects Immigrants. Then Funds Their Persecution.

New York City is home to more than **600,000 undocumented immigrants**. The city has declared itself a sanctuary city — a place that does not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

Then it pays Google.

**Google holds a cloud contract with Customs and Border Protection (2019).** Google sits on the **$9 billion JWCC military cloud contract** alongside Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle — powering the Department of Defense, intelligence agencies, and federal law enforcement.

Google created **Google Public Sector LLC** — a dedicated subsidiary — specifically to pursue military and law enforcement work. This isn't a side project. It's a growth strategy.

> **Google's CBP cloud contract. The $9B JWCC military deal. Google Public Sector LLC. Project Nimbus. NYC funds all of it — then calls itself a sanctuary city.**

And then there's **Project Nimbus**: Google's **$1.2 billion contract with the Israeli military**, providing AI tools for facial detection, object tracking, and surveillance. When Google workers at the **NYC office** protested Nimbus in April 2024, Google's response was swift: **approximately 50 workers were fired.**

Let that sit: Google fired workers *in New York City* for opposing a military AI contract. The city said nothing. The checks kept clearing.

NYC cannot credibly claim to protect immigrants while funding the infrastructure that surveils, detains, and deports them. Sanctuary means nothing if the city bankrolls the machine.

---

## 4. Built on Exploitation

# Record Profits. Poverty Wages. Union Busting.

Google posted **$307 billion in revenue** in 2023 — a company record. The same month, it laid off **12,000 workers**.

Nearly **half of Google's workforce** are temps, vendors, and contractors — so-called "TVCs" who do the same work for less pay, fewer benefits, and zero job security. This is by design.

Google's AI — the technology the company tells you will change the world — is trained in part by workers in Kenya earning **$1.32 to $2.00 per hour**, exposed to violent and traumatic content with minimal mental health support.

> **$307 billion in revenue. $1.32/hr for the workers who train its AI. This is the company NYC trusts with its infrastructure.**

When workers tried to organize, Google launched **"Project Vivian"** — an internal anti-union campaign developed with the help of union-busting consultants. The **"Thanksgiving Four"** — employees fired in 2019 — were found by the NLRB to have been **illegally retaliated against** for protected organizing activity.

Google paid **$118 million** to settle gender discrimination claims brought by **15,500 women**. Data center workers have reported being **denied water breaks**.

New York City has the strongest labor movement in America. We don't subsidize union busters. We don't pay companies that exploit workers. Or at least — we shouldn't.

---

## 5. Corporate Welfare, Public Risk

# $2.1 Billion in NYC Real Estate. Tax Breaks Included.

Google has poured over **$2.1 billion into its New York City real estate expansion**, building a massive campus across Chelsea and Hudson Square with more than **12,000 employees**. The city helped — with tax incentives.

NYC gave Google breaks to gentrify Manhattan. Google gave NYC vendor lock-in and opaque contracts.

> **We gave Google tax breaks to expand in NYC. Google gave us lock-in, hidden contracts, and a deportation cloud.**

Every agency on Google Cloud is one pricing change away from a budget crisis. Every school on Google Workspace is one policy shift away from a privacy catastrophe. The city owns none of this infrastructure. It controls none of the code. It can't audit, modify, or migrate without Google's permission.

This is the definition of institutional risk. And it was entirely avoidable.

# /HOW — HOW WE WIN

# How We Win

This isn't theoretical. The legal tools exist. The political pressure points are real. Other cities have done it. Here's the roadmap.

---

## What We're Demanding

### The Five Demands

1. **Full Disclosure** — Publish every active contract between NYC agencies and Google, including costs, terms, data-sharing provisions, and renewal dates. Make them searchable on Checkbook NYC and Open Data.

2. **Terminate and Transition** — Invoke termination-for-convenience clauses in all Google contracts and begin a managed 3-year transition to self-hosted, publicly-owned infrastructure.

3. **Protect Students First** — Immediately begin migrating NYC public schools off Google Workspace to privacy-respecting, open-source alternatives. No platform that refuses to comply with Ed-Law 2-d touches our kids.

4. **Create the NYC Digital Infrastructure Office** — Establish a new city office responsible for managing publicly-owned technology, accountable to the public and the City Council — not to vendors.

5. **Ban Corporate Cloud for Critical Systems** — Pass legislation prohibiting city agencies from running critical infrastructure (cybersecurity, law enforcement databases, student records) on platforms owned by companies holding military or immigration enforcement contracts.

---

## The Legal Levers

### We already have the tools. Nobody's using them.

**Termination-for-convenience clauses** exist in city contracts. These are standard provisions that allow the city to end a contract **with 30 days' notice**, for any reason. No breach required. No lawsuit. Just a letter.

**Comptroller Brad Lander** has the authority to **refuse to register contracts** he deems not in the public interest. He doesn't need the mayor's permission. He doesn't need a City Council vote. He can act now.

**The City Council Technology Committee**, chaired by **Council Member Carmen De La Rosa**, can hold hearings, subpoena documents, and draft legislation mandating public infrastructure standards.

> **The exit clauses already exist. The Comptroller can block new contracts tomorrow. The City Council can legislate. The only thing missing is pressure.**

---

## Precedents: It's Been Done

### NYC has done harder things than this.

**The CityTime Scandal** — NYC terminated a massive, corrupt technology contract and recovered $500 million+ in damages. The city has fired vendors before. It can do it again.

**Amazon HQ2** — In 2019, a coalition of New Yorkers forced Amazon to cancel its planned Queens headquarters and $3 billion in subsidies. A $2 trillion company backed down. It can happen twice.

### Other cities are already off Google.

| City / Region | What They Did | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Munich, Germany** | Migrated 15,000 desktops to Linux | Saved **€11.7 million**; re-committed to open source in 2024 |
| **France** | 72,000 police PCs on Ubuntu; custom Matrix messaging system | Full sovereignty over law enforcement communications |
| **Schleswig-Holstein** | 30,000 PCs switching to Nextcloud + LibreOffice | Largest active public-sector migration in Europe |
| **EU-wide** | Nextcloud demand **tripled** in 2025 | Continental shift toward digital sovereignty |

These aren't tech experiments. They're policy decisions by governments that decided public infrastructure should be publicly owned.

NYC is the largest city in America. If Schleswig-Holstein can do it, we can do it.

# /ABOUT — ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN

# About selfhost.nyc

## Who We Are

selfhost.nyc is a campaign to end New York City's dependency on Google and transition to publicly-owned, self-hosted digital infrastructure.

We are not anti-technology. We are pro-democracy. We believe the systems that run a city of 8 million people should be owned by those people — not licensed from a $2 trillion corporation with military contracts and a history of worker abuse.

We are parents, teachers, union members, immigrants, technologists, journalists, and organizers. We are backed by a coalition of organizations that have been fighting for digital rights, worker power, and immigrant justice long before this campaign existed.

## Why Now

Three things changed:

1. **The spending is indefensible.** We've identified tens of millions in hidden Google contracts with zero public oversight. The city can't even tell you how much it spends.

2. **The hypocrisy is undeniable.** Google's military and immigration enforcement contracts are a matter of public record. So is NYC's sanctuary city status. You can't hold both positions.

3. **The alternatives are proven.** Munich, France, Schleswig-Holstein — entire governments are migrating to open-source, self-hosted infrastructure. The question isn't whether it's possible. It's whether New York has the will.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Isn't this unrealistic? NYC can't just stop using Google.

NYC terminated the CityTime contract and recovered half a billion dollars. New Yorkers forced Amazon to cancel a $3 billion deal. Munich migrated 15,000 government desktops to Linux and saved €11.7 million. "Unrealistic" is what people say before it happens.

### What would NYC use instead?

Open-source alternatives that are already in production worldwide:
- **Email & collaboration:** Nextcloud, LibreOffice, Matrix/Element
- **Cloud infrastructure:** OpenStack, Kubernetes on city-owned servers
- **Education:** Moodle, Nextcloud Education, LibreOffice
- **Cybersecurity:** Open-source security stacks are used by governments across Europe

The technology exists. It's proven. It's cheaper. And the city would own it.

### Won't this cost more?

Munich saved €11.7 million. But more importantly: NYC is *already* spending $30–70 million a year on Google with no public cost analysis. We don't even know what we're paying now. The first step is transparency. The second is realizing that renting is always more expensive than owning — especially when the landlord keeps raising the rent.

### What about jobs? Google employs 12,000 people in NYC.

We're not asking Google to leave New York. We're asking the city to stop giving it contracts and tax breaks. Google's NYC employees work on advertising, search, and other commercial products — not city contracts. And a publicly-owned infrastructure program would create good, unionized tech jobs in city government.

### Is this really about Google, or about all Big Tech?

It starts with Google because that's where the city's dependency is deepest and most dangerous. But the principle applies broadly: **critical public infrastructure should be publicly owned.** If the campaign succeeds, it sets a precedent for how NYC handles every technology vendor.

### How do I know my data is safe with you?

We collect the minimum data necessary (name, zip, email) for petition delivery and event updates. We store it on self-hosted infrastructure — because we practice what we preach. We never share, sell, or monetize your information. Our privacy policy is short enough to actually read.
