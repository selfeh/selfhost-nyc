# selfhost.nyc — Campaign Messaging Framework & Narrative Strategy

**INTERNAL PLAYBOOK — NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION**
*Version 1.0 | February 2026*

---

## 1. Campaign Pillars

### Pillar 1: PROTECT OUR KIDS
**One-line:** New York City handed 1.1 million children's data to a company that won't even sign the state's privacy agreement.

**Key Facts:**
- 1.1M NYC students on Google Workspace for Education
- Google has refused to sign New York State's student privacy agreements
- No meaningful parental consent or opt-out mechanism
- Student behavioral data, location patterns, and developmental profiles harvested at scale

**Emotional Hook:** Every morning, parents trust the city with their children. The city trusts Google. Google trusts no one with answers about what it does with that data.

**Target Audience:** Parents, PTAs, education advocates, UFT members

---

### Pillar 2: SANCTUARY CITY, SURVEILLANCE BUDGET
**One-line:** NYC calls itself a sanctuary city — then writes checks to the company building deportation infrastructure.

**Key Facts:**
- Google holds CBP cloud contract and created Google Public Sector LLC specifically for enforcement work
- $9B military/intelligence cloud deal (JEDI successor)
- 600K+ undocumented immigrants live in NYC
- NYC pays Google $30–70M/year — effectively subsidizing ICE's tech stack
- Project Nimbus: $1.2B contract providing AI to Israeli military; ~50 NYC-based workers fired for protesting it

**Emotional Hook:** Your neighbor's deportation could be powered by software your tax dollars paid for. That's not a sanctuary. That's a contradiction.

**Target Audience:** Immigrant communities, advocacy orgs, faith leaders, progressive electeds, DSA, civil liberties groups

---

### Pillar 3: FOLLOW THE MONEY
**One-line:** Google extracts billions from New York while paying the city back in lobbying and tax-incentivized real estate deals.

**Key Facts:**
- $30–70M/year in city contracts, hidden from standard procurement databases
- $2.1B+ NYC real estate expansion with public tax incentives
- 12,000 workers laid off during a $307B revenue year
- ~50% of Google's workforce are temps, vendors, and contractors — many with no benefits
- AI trainers in Kenya paid $1.32/hour
- $118M gender discrimination settlement
- Anti-union program "Project Vivian" deployed against its own workers

**Emotional Hook:** They get tax breaks to build their offices here. We get surveilled in ours.

**Target Audience:** Fiscal hawks, labor/union members, city council budget committees, journalists, tech workers

---

### Pillar 4: IT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE
**One-line:** Munich, France, and Schleswig-Holstein already broke up with Big Tech. New York is just late.

**Key Facts:**
- Munich migrated city government to Linux/open source (LiMux, then returned, then went back again — proving lock-in is the real enemy)
- France banned Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 from government use
- Schleswig-Holstein migrating 25,000 government workers to LibreOffice and open source
- Termination-for-convenience clauses already exist in NYC contracts
- NYC Comptroller has authority to block contract renewals

**Emotional Hook:** This isn't radical. It's overdue. Other cities did it. New York is supposed to lead — not follow.

**Target Audience:** Policy wonks, city council members, editorial boards, tech community

---

### Pillar 5: BUILD THE ALTERNATIVE
**One-line:** Self-hosting isn't just a protest — it's an infrastructure investment in the city itself.

**Key Facts:**
- NYC Mesh already provides community-owned internet infrastructure
- $30–70M/year redirected could fund city-owned email, storage, and collaboration tools
- Local hosting creates local tech jobs — not contractor gigs in Virginia data centers
- Open-source tools (Nextcloud, Matrix, LibreOffice) are production-ready and in use by governments worldwide

**Emotional Hook:** What if the money we send to Mountain View stayed in the five boroughs?

**Target Audience:** Tech workers, civic technologists, urbanists, small business owners, city innovation offices

---

## 2. Core Narrative

### The Story

**The Villain:** Google — not as a cartoonish evil, but as the logical endpoint of unchecked monopoly power. A company so embedded in public infrastructure that it can refuse to sign student privacy agreements and still keep the contract. A company that builds deportation tools with one hand and cashes sanctuary city checks with the other. A company that fires workers for speaking up and replaces them with $1.32/hour contractors overseas.

**The Hero:** New Yorkers — parents, teachers, immigrants, workers, technologists — who decide that public infrastructure should serve the public. Not shareholders in Mountain View.

**What's at Stake:** Democratic control of public technology. If the city can't say no to Google, it can't say yes to its own residents. Every year the contracts renew is another year of dependency, another year of student data extracted, another year of funding surveillance infrastructure that targets our own communities.

**The Vision:** A New York City that owns its digital infrastructure the way it owns its water system. Not because it's easy, but because public goods shouldn't have a corporate login screen. The money stays local. The data stays local. The jobs stay local. The accountability is to voters, not venture capital.

### Narrative Arc

**Act 1 — Reveal:** Most New Yorkers don't know their city spends $30–70M/year on Google. Most parents don't know their kids' school data sits on servers controlled by a company that won't sign the state's own privacy rules. We start by making the invisible visible.

**Act 2 — Connect:** This isn't a tech story. It's a labor story (exploited workers). It's an immigration story (deportation infrastructure). It's a budget story (hidden spending). It's a parenting story (unprotected children). We connect each audience to the issue through their own door.

**Act 3 — Empower:** This is solvable. The contracts have exit clauses. Other cities have done it. The tools exist. The coalition exists. What's missing is political will — and we're here to supply it.

## 3. Key Messages

### Master Message (30 seconds)
> New York City spends up to $70 million a year on Google — a company that refuses to sign our state's student privacy agreements, builds cloud infrastructure for immigration enforcement, and fires workers who speak up. Our city has the legal right to end these contracts. Other cities have already done it. It's time New York caught up. selfhost.nyc is building the coalition to make it happen.

### Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)
> Every year, New York City quietly sends tens of millions of taxpayer dollars to Google. In return, 1.1 million students have their data processed by a company that won't sign New York's own privacy agreements. The city that calls itself a sanctuary funds a company with CBP cloud contracts and a $9 billion military deal. Google laid off 12,000 people during a record-profit year, pays AI trainers $1.32 an hour, and crushed internal organizing with a program called Project Vivian.
>
> Here's the thing — NYC's contracts already have termination-for-convenience clauses. The Comptroller can block renewals. Munich, France, and German states have already migrated to open-source alternatives. The tools exist. The legal mechanisms exist. What's been missing is organized public pressure.
>
> selfhost.nyc is building that pressure — a coalition of parents, teachers, immigrants' rights groups, labor, and technologists demanding the city take back control of its own digital infrastructure. The $30–70 million we send to Mountain View every year could fund locally hosted, publicly accountable technology that keeps data in the city and jobs in the boroughs.

### For Parents
> Your child's school runs on Google. Google won't sign New York's student privacy agreement. That means there's no enforceable promise about what happens to your kid's data — their searches, their documents, their patterns. You didn't consent to this. The city decided for you. We think parents should have a say in who gets access to their children's digital lives.

### For Immigrants / Immigrant Advocates
> New York calls itself a sanctuary city. But every year, the city pays Google — the same company that built a cloud platform for Customs and Border Protection and created a whole subsidiary, Google Public Sector LLC, to do enforcement work. NYC's tax dollars are flowing to a company that powers the infrastructure of deportation. That's not sanctuary. That's subsidy. We're demanding the city stop funding its own residents' persecution.

### For Union Members / Workers
> Google laid off 12,000 workers during a year it made $307 billion in revenue. Half its workforce are temps and contractors with no benefits. It ran an internal anti-union program called Project Vivian. It paid a $118 million gender discrimination settlement. And it paid AI trainers in Kenya $1.32 an hour. This is the company New York City chose to trust with public infrastructure. Labor built this city. Labor should demand the city stop funding companies that exploit workers.

### For Tech Workers
> You know the alternatives work. Nextcloud, Matrix, LibreOffice — they're production-grade and deployed by European governments. What's missing isn't technology; it's political will. selfhost.nyc needs engineers, sysadmins, and designers who can prove the migration path is real. This is a chance to build public infrastructure that actually serves the public — not just a résumé line at a company that fires people for having a conscience.

### For City Council Members
> The city spends $30–70 million per year on Google contracts that aren't even visible in standard procurement databases. That's a transparency problem and a fiscal problem. Termination-for-convenience clauses already exist. The Comptroller can block renewals. European cities have proven the migration is viable. This isn't a radical proposal — it's a procurement decision. The question is whether you're comfortable explaining to constituents why you kept funding a company that won't protect their children's data and builds tools for immigration enforcement.

### For Media
> New York City is quietly one of Google's biggest municipal customers — $30–70M/year, largely hidden from public procurement databases. 1.1 million students are on Google Workspace, but Google has refused to sign the state's student data privacy agreements. The same city that declared itself a sanctuary sends tens of millions annually to a company with CBP cloud contracts. selfhost.nyc is a new coalition — parents, immigrants' rights groups, labor, and technologists — demanding the city exercise existing contract exit clauses and migrate to self-hosted, open-source alternatives, following the path already taken by Munich, France, and Schleswig-Holstein.

## 5. Opposition Messaging & Counter-Arguments

### "Migration would be too expensive and disruptive."
**Counter:** We're already paying $30–70M/year — forever, with annual increases. Migration is a one-time investment that eliminates a permanent dependency. Schleswig-Holstein is migrating 25,000 workers. NYC has more resources than a German state. The real cost is staying.

### "Google Workspace is the best product. Alternatives can't compete."
**Counter:** France disagrees. Their government banned Google Workspace. Nextcloud and LibreOffice serve millions of users globally, including European governments with higher security requirements than NYC. "Best product" is a marketing claim, not a procurement standard.

### "This would hurt students and teachers mid-year."
**Counter:** No one is proposing pulling the plug tomorrow. We're proposing the city stop auto-renewing and begin a phased transition. The disruption argument is a stalling tactic — the same one used to block every infrastructure transition in history.

### "Google provides these services at a discount / for free."
**Counter:** Nothing is free. The currency is data — 1.1 million children's data. And the "discount" still costs $30–70M/year. If it's so cheap, why is it hidden from procurement databases?

### "The city doesn't have the technical capacity to self-host."
**Counter:** The city runs the largest municipal water system in the country, a police surveillance network, and a 311 system serving 8 million people. It can run an email server. And the $30–70M/year freed up can hire the people to do it — creating local jobs instead of enriching Mountain View.

### "Google's government contracts are separate from its education products."
**Counter:** They're the same company. The same engineering talent. The same cloud infrastructure. The same leadership that created Google Public Sector LLC and fired workers who protested Project Nimbus. You can't separate the balance sheet from the ethics sheet.

### "This is just anti-tech activism."
**Counter:** This is pro-public-tech activism. We want *more* technology — just publicly owned, publicly accountable, and locally hosted. We're not Luddites. We're the people who actually know how the servers work.

### "The Comptroller / Council doesn't have the authority."
**Counter:** Termination-for-convenience clauses exist in the contracts. The Comptroller's office has review and approval authority over contract renewals. This is settled municipal law, not a novel legal theory.

## 6. Social Media Content Calendar

### Platform Strategy

**X (Twitter):** Primary rapid-response and news hook platform. Threads for deep dives. Quote-tweet city officials and Google PR. Tag journalists. Confrontational tone acceptable.

**Bluesky:** Community-building and coalition signaling. More conversational. Cross-post key content from X. Engage the tech-progressive audience that migrated from Twitter.

**Instagram:** Visual storytelling. Infographics, parent testimonials, protest photos, data visualizations. Reels for short explainers. Stories for real-time campaign updates. This is where we reach parents and younger audiences.
