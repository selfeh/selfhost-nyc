# NYC Government Technology Contracts: Legal & Procurement Landscape

## 1. How NYC Procurement Works for Technology Contracts

### Governing Framework
- **NYC Charter §§311-334** and the **Procurement Policy Board (PPB) Rules** (Title 9 RCNY) govern all city procurement
- **Mayor's Office of Contract Services (MOCS)** oversees the process; the **Office of Technology & Innovation (OTI)** (formerly DoITT) is the primary technology procuring agency
- All contracts go through **PASSPort** (the city's procurement tracking system)

### Procurement Methods
- **Competitive Sealed Bidding (CSB):** Default for goods; lowest responsible bidder wins (PPB Rules §3-02)
- **Competitive Sealed Proposals (CSP):** Used for most technology/services contracts where price isn't the sole factor; allows negotiation (PPB Rules §3-03)
- **Sole Source:** Permitted only when one vendor uniquely can provide the goods/services (PPB Rules §3-05). Requires written justification, agency head approval, and publication in the City Record. **This is the weakest link** — many Big Tech contracts use sole source or "proprietary" justification that can be challenged
- **Innovative Procurement:** PPB Rules §3-12 allows pilot programs and alternative methods for new technology
- **Master Service Agreements / Requirements Contracts:** OTI uses citywide IT requirements contracts that agencies order from — these aggregate enormous spend with minimal per-transaction oversight

### Sole Source Vulnerability
The sole source justification for Big Tech typically rests on "ecosystem lock-in" arguments. These can be challenged by demonstrating:
- Viable alternatives exist (open-source, competing vendors)
- The city failed to conduct market research (PPB Rules §2-02 requires it)
- Interoperability standards were not considered

## 2. Mechanisms to Terminate or Not Renew Contracts

### Termination Provisions
- **Termination for Convenience:** Standard city contract clauses allow the city to terminate any contract for convenience with 30 days' written notice. Vendor is paid for work completed but has no claim to lost profits. **This is the most powerful lever.**
- **Termination for Cause/Default:** If vendor breaches terms, fails performance standards, or violates law
- **Non-renewal:** Multi-year contracts with option years simply aren't renewed.

### Comptroller Authority (NYC Charter §§93, 328)
- **Contract Registration:** The Comptroller must register all contracts >$100K. Can **refuse to register** if contract was not awarded in compliance with PPB Rules, adequate funds are not available, or the vendor is not responsible
- **Audit Power:** Can audit any contract at any time
- **Current Comptroller: Mark Levine** (took office Jan 2026)

### City Council Oversight
- **Committee on Technology** — oversees OTI (Chair: **Carmen De La Rosa**)
- **Committee on Contracts** — oversees procurement policy
- Council can hold oversight hearings, pass Local Laws, use budget power, issue resolutions, require reporting

### Mayoral Executive Orders
- Can direct agencies to conduct technology audits, prioritize open-source, mandate data sovereignty, consolidate/renegotiate vendors

## 3. Relevant NYC Laws

- **Local Law 245 of 2017:** Automated Decision Systems Task Force — precedent for tech oversight
- **Local Law 144 of 2021:** Regulates automated employment decision tools
- **Local Law 11 of 2012 (Open Data Law):** City data should be publicly accessible, not locked in proprietary systems
- **NYC Charter §1052:** Grants OTI authority over citywide IT policy
- **NY SHIELD Act (2019):** Data security safeguards — argument against foreign-controlled clouds
- **POST Act:** Required NYPD to disclose surveillance technology

## 4. Key Political Targets

### City Council — Technology Committee
- **Carmen De La Rosa** (Chair) — Primary target
- **Amanda Farías, Julie Won, Jennifer Gutiérrez, Shahana Hanif**
- **Public Advocate Jumaane Williams** — Can introduce legislation, conduct investigations

## 5. Precedents for Terminating Major Contracts

- **CityTime Scandal (2011):** Terminated $63M SAIC contract after costs ballooned to $700M+. $500M+ restitution.
- **Amazon HQ2 (2019):** Political mobilization killed $3B incentive deal.
- **LinkNYC/CityBridge:** Google/Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs faced scrutiny over data collection, led to modifications.

## 6. Actionable Levers

### Immediate
1. FOIL requests for all current technology contracts and sole-source justifications
2. Comptroller audit request to Mark Levine
3. Council testimony at Technology/Contracts Committee hearings
4. Resolution introduction via Carmen De La Rosa or progressive members

### Medium-Term Legislative
5. Local Law for Open-Source Preference
6. Data Sovereignty Local Law
7. Contract Exit Strategy Law
8. Technology Spending Transparency Law

### Pressure Points
9. Termination for convenience clauses already exist in current contracts
10. Non-renewal of option years requires no justification
11. Comptroller registration refusal can block new/renewed contracts
12. Budget hearings — Council can zero out specific vendor line items
