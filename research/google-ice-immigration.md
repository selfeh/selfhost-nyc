# Google's Involvement with ICE, CBP, and Immigration Enforcement

## The Core Contradiction
NYC is a sanctuary city paying Google — while Google provides cloud infrastructure, AI, and technical services to CBP and DHS, the agencies conducting raids in NYC neighborhoods.

## Key Facts

### Direct Federal Contracts
- **CBP Cloud Contract (2019):** Google Cloud won a contract with CBP for cloud infrastructure via GSA
- **JWCC (2022):** Google won a portion of the $9B Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract serving all DoD components
- **FedRAMP authorized:** Any federal agency including ICE/CBP can procure Google Cloud services
- **Google Public Sector LLC (2022):** Separate subsidiary created specifically to chase military/enforcement contracts with fewer internal ethical objections

### Project Nimbus — Israel Parallel
- **$1.2B contract** with Israeli government (Google + AWS), announced April 2021
- Provides cloud, AI, ML to ALL Israeli government agencies including military/intelligence
- Google contractually forbidden from denying service to any Israeli entity including IDF
- AI capabilities include facial detection, object tracking, sentiment analysis — same tools used by CBP
- **April 2024: ~50 workers fired** for protesting Nimbus at Google's NYC and Sunnyvale offices

### Subcontracting Pipeline
- **Palantir** (ICE's primary tech contractor, FALCON system) uses cloud infrastructure from major providers
- **Deloitte** — major DHS/ICE contractor AND Google Cloud Premier Partner
- **Accenture, Booz Allen, SAIC** — federal integrators, Google partners, serve DHS/ICE

### CBP Usage
- CBP's cloud migration includes Google Cloud Platform
- CBP uses Google Workspace for internal communications
- Google Maps/Earth data used by CBP for terrain mapping and surveillance
- CBP Innovation Team has explored Google AI/ML for border surveillance analytics

## NYC Sanctuary City Conflict

### NYC's Protections
- Sanctuary city since Executive Order 41 (2003), strengthened by Detainer Law (2014)
- City agencies prohibited from honoring ICE detainers
- MOIA actively provides legal services to ~600K immigrant New Yorkers

### The Hypocrisy
- Google's NYC campus (Chelsea/Hudson Square): 12,000+ employees, massive tax incentives
- NYC agencies use Google products while Google serves the agencies hunting NYC residents
- Workers fired for protesting were at the NYC office
- NYC pension funds hold significant Alphabet stock

### Campaign Argument
> Every dollar NYC gives Google potentially subsidizes the tech stack used to find, track, and deport the people NYC claims to protect.

## 2025-2026 Context
- Trump admin ICE enforcement dramatically escalated, targeting sanctuary cities
- ICE raids in NYC increasing — near courthouses, schools, churches
- Google's defense revenue growing, openly competing for military/intelligence AI
- The conflict has never been sharper
