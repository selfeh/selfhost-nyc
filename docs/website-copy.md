# THE CHARGES

---

## Google takes New York's money.

$30–70 million a year. That's the estimate — because the actual figure doesn't appear in any public database. Not Checkbook NYC. Not the Open Data portal. Nowhere.

NYC Cyber Command — cybersecurity for 100+ city agencies — runs entirely on Google Cloud. Cost: $10–30 million a year. No public contract. No competitive bid on record. No exit plan.

New York can't tell you what it pays Google. That's not an accident.

---

## Google takes New York's children.

1.1 million public school students on Google Workspace. 350,000 Chromebooks in classrooms across every borough.

New York State Ed-Law 2-d says companies must sign privacy agreements before handling student data. Google won't sign for YouTube, Maps, or Search — the services students use every day through their school accounts.

The Department of Education signed the contracts anyway.

---

## Google takes New York's safety.

NYC is a sanctuary city. City law says agencies don't cooperate with ICE. Policy says immigrants are protected. Then the city pays Google.

Google holds a cloud contract with Customs and Border Protection. Google sits on a $9 billion Pentagon cloud deal — CBP, the agency conducting raids in NYC neighborhoods, is a customer. Google created an entire subsidiary, Google Public Sector LLC, to chase military and law enforcement work.

50 Google workers staged a sit-in at the Chelsea office to protest. Google fired them.

---

## Google takes New York's workers.

$307 billion in revenue in 2023. Record year. Google laid off 12,000 people. Locked their accounts before telling them.

Half of Google's workforce are temps and contractors. Same desks. Lower pay. No security.

Google's AI gets trained by workers in Kenya making $1.32 an hour. Violent content. Traumatic material. Minimal support.

When workers organized, Google ran "Project Vivian" — an anti-union operation with hired consultants. The NLRB found Google illegally fired organizers. Google settled gender discrimination claims from 15,500 women for $118 million.

---

## Google takes New York's tax dollars.

$2.1 billion poured into NYC real estate. Chelsea. Hudson Square. 12,000+ employees. City tax incentives helped make it happen.

What did New York get back? Vendor lock-in on contracts it can't find in its own transparency tools. Systems it doesn't own. Code it can't audit. Data it can't move.

---

## Google takes. New York pays.

Every year, the cycle continues. Public money flows to a company that surveils children, arms border enforcement, exploits workers, hides its contracts, and fires anyone who objects.

---

# THE EXIT

# New York can take it back.

The termination clauses are already in the contracts. 30 days' written notice. No breach required.

**Comptroller Mark Levine** can refuse to register Google contracts tomorrow. No vote needed.

**The City Council** can hold hearings, subpoena records, pass laws requiring transparency and public ownership.

**It's been done before.**

NYC terminated the CityTime contract. Recovered $500 million. New Yorkers killed Amazon's $3 billion HQ2 deal. Munich switched 15,000 desktops to Linux and saved €11.7 million. France runs 72,000 police computers on open-source. Schleswig-Holstein is migrating 30,000 PCs right now.

## Five demands.

1. **Publish every contract.** Costs, terms, data provisions, renewal dates. In Checkbook NYC. Now.
2. **Terminate and transition.** Use the exit clauses. Move to publicly-owned infrastructure over 3 years.
3. **Protect students first.** Off Google Workspace. No platform that won't comply with Ed-Law 2-d.
4. **Ban conflicted vendors.** No city contracts with companies providing services to ICE or CBP.
5. **Build public infrastructure.** Create a NYC Digital Infrastructure Office. Public staff. Public code.
